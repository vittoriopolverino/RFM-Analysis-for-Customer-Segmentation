## What **RFM Analysis** is?

RFM analysis is a data-driven segmentation technique that uses **Recency, Frequency and Monetary** to divide customers into various categories or clusters and identify who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization services. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a **customer’s behavior** because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

• **Recency** - How recently a customer has made a purchase

• **Frequency** - How often a customer makes a purchase

• **Monetary** - How much money a customer spends on purchase
